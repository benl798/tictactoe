# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is Ben Luck's project, built as part of the Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly, Sydney.

## How it was built

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to build the game.

## How to play

You have been assigned the character 'Gengar' and will take turns playing against the CPU ('Mew'). To win you must be the first to align three of your symbols in a row, column or diagonally.

The game will track the number of games both you and the CPU has won. To reset the board and play again simply click the 'Reset' button (don't worry this won't clear the score count!).

Enjoy!

> This game is a classic that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master!
